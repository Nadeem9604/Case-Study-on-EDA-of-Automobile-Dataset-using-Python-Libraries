Handling Missing Values
When data is missing from a dataset, it may be represented by other values such as '?' question marks, '-' dashes or blank spaces.
These values can create problems during data analysis as they cannot be recognized as missing data by most software packages and can 
interfere with calculations and statistics.
By converting these values to NaN (Not a Number), we can standardize the representation of missing data and make it easier to handle 
and process during data analysis. NaN values are recognized by most software packages as missing data and can be easily removed, 
imputed or handled in other ways during data analysis. NaN stands for "Not a Number". It is a special floating-point value in 
Python that represents an undefined or unrepresentable value. In the context of datasets, NaN values typically represent 
missing or undefined values."""
